## 🧬 The Manifesto

The web has been colonized by the generic. AI-generated interfaces have commoditized "good taste," filling our screens with predictable shadows, rounded corners, and a lack of character. 

**VENA Visual Engine (VVE)** is a rebellion. It is not another CSS framework for "friendly" apps. It is a **Sovereign Infrastructure** for building digital interfaces that reflect precision, authority, and longevity. We don't build "UI components"; we build **Visual Protocols**.

## 🏛️ Axioms of the Engine

1.  **Precision over Organic:** We reject the "round-everything" culture. Surfaces should feel like precision-cut steel.
2.  **Hardware Awareness:** Altitude-conscious design. We optimize for the screen where the work happens (Laptops), not just the desk where we design (2K/4K).
3.  **Context Sovereignty:** The engine differentiates between Application, Landing, and Laboratory realities, injecting specific infrastructure resets for each.
4.  **The Active Pulse:** Interfaces are live signals. We treat the rendering process as a vital pulse of data.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
npm install @dammgo/vena-visual-engine unocss
```

## 📡 Quick Start (UnoCSS)

VVE is designed to be consumed as a **UnoCSS Preset**.

```typescript
// uno.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'unocss'
import { presetVena } from '@dammgo/vena-visual-engine'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [
    presetVena({
      protocol: 'erpbsg' // Options: 'erpbsg' | 'dammgo' | 'vena' | 'kode-reboot'
    }),
  ],
})
```
